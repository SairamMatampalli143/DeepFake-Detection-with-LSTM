# Deep Fake Face Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
The "Deep Fake Face Detection Using Machine Learning" project aims to combat the proliferation of deep fake content by developing an end-to-end system capable of identifying manipulated images and videos. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, this project provides a robust solution for detecting synthetic faces and distinguishing them from genuine ones.

## Key Components
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Curated a diverse dataset containing real and deep fake face images.
   - Performed data augmentation to enhance model generalization.

2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture**:
   - Designed a custom CNN architecture for feature extraction.
   - Trained the model on the dataset using transfer learning (e.g., pre-trained ResNet or VGG).

3. **Facial Feature Extraction**:
   - Extracted facial landmarks and features using OpenCV or Dlib.
   - Calculated feature vectors for real and synthetic faces.

4. **Classification Model**:
   - Built a binary classifier to distinguish between real and deep fake faces.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize accuracy and minimize false positives.

5. **Deployment and Integration**:
   - Deployed the model as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI.
   - Integrated the API with a web-based interface for user-friendly interaction.

6. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Implemented logging and monitoring to track model performance.
   - Scheduled regular retraining to adapt to evolving deep fake techniques.

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy in detecting deep fake faces.
- Conducted extensive testing on synthetic videos and images.
- Contributed to the fight against misinformation and digital manipulation.

## Future Enhancements
- Explore ensemble methods (e.g., combining CNNs with GANs) for improved robustness.
- Investigate adversarial training to make the model more resistant to sophisticated attacks.
- Collaborate with other researchers to enhance the dataset and address bias issues.
